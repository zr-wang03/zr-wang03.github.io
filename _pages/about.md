<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Minor in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. During which time, I have been awarded University of Toronto Scholar scholarship and have consistently been on the Dean's Honor List each semester. 

My professional experience spans roles as a Software Sevelopment Engineer at Amazon as well as a Machine Learning Researcher at Huawei Canada, where I have explored cutting-edge topics in computer vision, diffusion models, and federated learning. I am passionate about designing innovative solutions, such as finetuning diffusion models under few shot settings. 

In addition, I enjoy leading projects like website redesigns and applying deep learning to real-world challenges, such as sleep monitoring. Through these experiences, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the field of artificial intelligence.
